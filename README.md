KPNC Technology: Stockpile is a ticker tracker (including popular stocks and futures). While Stockpile did actively track and update ticker prices and statistics it no longer does. Stockpile tracked tickers from the S&P-500, NASDAQ-100, and the DowJones-30 components as well as a few popular futures...

STOCKPILE IS A DEMO PROJECT: While Stockpile can and had tracked tickers actively, it is no longer updating and the data will eventually decay through synchronization issues (and is already out of date...duh)
