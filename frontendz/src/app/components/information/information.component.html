      <h2>Market Data</h2>
      <p><strong>IEX Cloud Services</strong></p>
      <p>
        The underlying information being displayed in Trader is provided by IEX Cloud. Without IEX Cloud's free plan, this little passion/practice project would have never come to fruition.

      <h2>Backend Technologies</h2>
      <p><strong>Cloudflare Workers, IEX Cloud API</strong></p>
      <p>
        The backend of Trader uses IEX Cloud (see above) to get current information on stock markets. Currently Trader only supports the NDX (NASDAQ-100 Index) which includes the top 100 NASDAQ companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. All backend requests are routed through Cloudflare Workers, a relatively new serverless services by Cloudflare that allows for low latency requests that power the entire site.

      <h2>Frontend Technologies</h2>
      <p><strong>Angular, ECharts, Chart.js</strong></p>
      <p>
        The frontend of Trader uses the Angular framework for a powerfull and performant experience. However data visualization is arguably just as important in Trader's use case. Trader uses two different chart libraries with accompanying wrappers, ECharts with ngx-echarts and Chart.js with ng2-charts. ECharts is blazingly fast and is able to allow for the quick browsing capabilities of the exchange page. Chart.js is beautiful with easy curve, gradient, and directive support for the multiple detailed views within the quote pages.
