        <h2>Frontend Technologies</h2>
        <p><strong>Angular, ECharts, Lightweight Charts</strong></p>
        <p>
          The frontend of Trader uses Google's Angular framework for a powerful and performant experience. However, data visualization is arguably just as important in trading so Trader uses Apache's ECharts for general charting and TradingView's Lightweight Charts for financial specific charting. Lightweight Charts provides fast and easy financial based charts that are incredibly customizable.
